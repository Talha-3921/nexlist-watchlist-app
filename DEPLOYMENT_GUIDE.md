## ðŸŽ¯ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT (SUPER DETAILED STEPS)

### **STEP 1: CREATE NEW PROJECT (You're logged in)**

1. **Look for a button that says "New Project"** or "Add New..." (usually blue button)

   - It's typically in the top-right area of your dashboard
   - Click it

2. **You'll see "Import Git Repository"**

   - Look for a section that says "Import Git Repository"
   - You should see GitHub icon/option
   - Click on it if needed

3. **Find Your Repository**
   - You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
   - Look for: **`nexlist-watchlist-app`**
   - Click the **"Import"** button next to it

### **STEP 2: CONFIGURE DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS**

You'll now see a configuration page. Fill in EXACTLY like this:

**PROJECT NAME:**

- Should auto-fill as `nexlist-watchlist-app`
- Leave it as is

**FRAMEWORK PRESET:**

- There's a dropdown that might say "Next.js" or "Create React App"
- Click the dropdown and select **"Other"**

**ROOT DIRECTORY:**

- Leave this field **completely empty** (don't type anything)
- If there's a "./" remove it and leave blank

**BUILD AND OUTPUT SETTINGS:**
Click "Override" if you see it, then fill:

- **Build Command:** Type exactly: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** Type exactly: `client/build`
- **Install Command:** Type exactly: `npm run install-all`

### **STEP 3: ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (SUPER IMPORTANT!)**

Before clicking Deploy, look for **"Environment Variables"** section:

1. **Click "Add" or the "+" button**

2. **Add these 3 variables one by one:**

   **Variable 1:**

   - Name: `MONGODB_URI`
   - Value: `mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster.mongodb.net/nexlist`
     (Replace with your actual MongoDB connection string)

   **Variable 2:**

   - Name: `JWT_SECRET`
   - Value: `mynexlistsecretkey2025`

   **Variable 3:**

   - Name: `NODE_ENV`
   - Value: `production`

### **STEP 4: DEPLOY!**

- **Click the big "Deploy" button**
- **Wait 2-5 minutes** (you'll see build logs)
- **Don't close the page!**

### Step 2: Environment Variables on Vercel
