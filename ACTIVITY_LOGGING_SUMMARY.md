# Activity Logging Implementation Summary - CLOUD-BASED

## ✅ **UPGRADED TO MONGODB CLOUD STORAGE**

### **Key Changes:**

- **BEFORE**: Activities stored in localStorage (device-specific)
- **NOW**: Activities stored in MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ **MongoDB Atlas Integration**: Persistent cloud storage
  - ✅ **Cross-Device Sync**: Activities appear on all user devices
  - ✅ **Data Persistence**: Never lost, even if browser data is cleared
  - ✅ **Scalable Storage**: Handles unlimited activities with automatic cleanup
  - ✅ **Offline Support**: Local cache fallback when offline
  - ✅ **User Authentication**: Each user's activities are private and secure
  - ✅ **Database Indexing**: Fast queries and optimal performance

## Activities Now Being Logged:

### Authentication Activities

- ✅ **Login** - When user successfully logs in
- ✅ **Logout** - When user logs out

### Profile Activities

- ✅ **Profile Update** - When user updates profile information (name, email, username)
- ✅ **Password Change** - When user changes their password

### Watchlist Activities

- ✅ **Add to Watchlist** - When item is added to Watchlist from Discover page
- ✅ **Remove from Watchlist** - When item is removed from Watchlist
- ✅ **Update Media Status** - When item status changes (Watching → Completed, etc.)
- ✅ **Rate Media** - When user rates a completed item
- ✅ **Update Progress** - When user updates progress for an item

### Folder Activities

- ✅ **Create Folder** - When custom folder is created
- ✅ **Delete Folder** - When custom folder is deleted
- ✅ **Share Folder** - When folder is shared via link
- ✅ **Add to Folder** - When item is added to custom folder
- ✅ **Move Between Folders** - When item is moved from one folder to another
- ✅ **Remove from Folder** - When item is moved back to default category

## Activity Data Structure:

Each activity includes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Type**: Activity type constant
- **Title**: Human-readable description
- **Details**: Additional metadata (item names, folder names, etc.)
- **Timestamp**: ISO date string
- **Date**: Formatted date for display

## Storage:

- **✅ MONGODB DATABASE**: Activities stored in MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- **✅ USER-SPECIFIC**: Each activity is linked to user ID with proper authentication
- **✅ INDEXED QUERIES**: Optimized with database indexes for fast retrieval
- **✅ AUTO-CLEANUP**: Automatically keeps only last 100 activities per user
- **✅ LOCAL CACHE**: Local cache for offline support and faster loading
- **✅ AUTO-SYNC**: Automatically syncs between cloud and local cache
- **✅ OFFLINE SUPPORT**: Can log activities offline, syncs when online
- **✅ CROSS-DEVICE**: Activities sync across all user devices automatically

## MongoDB Schema:

```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId (indexed),
  type: String (indexed),
  title: String,
  details: Mixed Object,
  timestamp: Date (indexed),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints:

- **POST /api/activities** - Log new activity
- **GET /api/activities** - Get user's activities (with optional limit)
- **DELETE /api/activities** - Clear all user activities
- **GET /api/activities/stats** - Get activity statistics

## Display:

- Activities show in Profile → Recent Activity tab
- Different activity types have different colored indicators
- Shows formatted date and descriptive text
- Handles empty state gracefully

## Integration Points:

- **AuthContext**: Login/logout logging
- **Profile Component**: Profile updates, password changes
- **Watchlist Component**: Item management, folder operations
- **Discover Component**: Adding items to Watchlist/folders
